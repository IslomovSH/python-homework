## Dictionary Exercises

### 1. Sort a Dictionary by Value
Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.

### 2. Add a Key to a Dictionary
Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.

**Sample Dictionary:**
```python
{0: 10, 1: 20}
```

**Expected Result:**
```python
{0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}
```

### 3. Concatenate Multiple Dictionaries
Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.

**Sample Dictionaries:**
```python
dic1 = {1: 10, 2: 20}
dic2 = {3: 30, 4: 40}
dic3 = {5: 50, 6: 60}
```

**Expected Result:**
```python
{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}
```

### 4. Generate a Dictionary with Squares
Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form `(x, x*x)`.

**Sample Dictionary (n = 5):**
```python
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

### 5. Dictionary of Squares (1 to 15)
